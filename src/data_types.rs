    // A scalar type represents a single value.
    // Rust has four primary scalar types: integers, floating-point numbers
    // Booleans, and characters.

    // An integer is a number without a fractional component.
    // If the integer type starts with 'u', then it's unsigned,
    // If it starts with 'i', then it's signed integer.
    // Signed and unsigned refer to whether it's possible for the number
    // to be negative.
    
    // Each signed variant can store numbers from -(2^n-1) to 2^n-1 - 1 inclusive,
    // where n is the number of bits that variant uses.
    // So an i8 can store numbers from -(2^7) to 2^7 - 1, which equals -128 to 127.
    // Unsigned variants can store numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1, so a u8 can store
    // numbers from 0 to 2^8 - 1, which equals 0 to 255.

    // Number literals can also use _ as a visual seperator to make the number

    // some sort of collection.
    
    // Rust has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers

    *  - Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink
    *    in size.
    *  - Tuples are created by writing a comma-seperated list of values inside
    *    parantheses.
    *  - Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the different
    *    values in the tuple don't have to be the same. */

    // value.
    
    /*      - Arrays are another way to have a collection of multiple values.
     *      - Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type.
     *      - In Rust, arrays are fixed in size.
     *      - Arrays are created using a comma-seperated list inside square brackets.
     *      - Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather
     *        than the heap or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number
     *        of elements.
     *      - An array isn't as flexible as the vector type. 
     *      - A vector is a similar collection type that is allowed to grow or shrink in size.
     *      - Arrays are most useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change.
     *      - You write an array's type using square brackets with the type of each element, a
     *        semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array.
     *      - You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by specifying
     *        the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square
     *        brackets such as let a = [3; 5];
     *      - An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be
     *        allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing such as let
     *        first = a[0];
